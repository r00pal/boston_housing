# 
# Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!
# 
# In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

# ## Getting Started
# In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.
# 
# The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:
# - 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.
# - 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.
# - The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.
# - The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.
# 
# Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

## Data Exploration
In this first section of this project, you will make a cursory investigation about the Boston housing data and provide your observations. Familiarizing yourself with the data through an explorative process is a fundamental practice to help you better understand and justify your results.
Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need to separate the dataset into **features** and the **target variable**. The **features**, `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`, give us quantitative information about each data point. The **target variable**, `'MEDV'`, will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in `features` and `prices`, respectively.


# ### Implementation: Calculate Statistics
# For your very first coding implementation, you will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing prices. Since `numpy` has already been imported for you, use this library to perform the necessary calculations. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze various prediction results from the constructed model.
# 
# In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of `'MEDV'`, which is stored in `prices`.
#   - Store each calculation in their respective variable.

# In[4]:

# TODO: Minimum price of the data
minimum_price = np.min(prices);

# TODO: Maximum price of the data

maximum_price = np.max(prices);

# TODO: Mean price of the data
mean_price =np.mean(prices);

# TODO: Median price of the data
median_price =np.median(prices);

# TODO: Standard deviation of prices of the data
std_price = np.std(prices);

# Show the calculated statistics
print "Statistics for Boston housing dataset:\n"
print "Minimum price: ${:,.2f}".format(float(minimum_price))
print "Maximum price: ${:,.2f}".format(float(maximum_price))
print "Mean price: ${:,.2f}".format(float(mean_price))
print "Median price ${:,.2f}".format(float(median_price))
print "Standard deviation of prices: ${:,.2f}".format(float(std_price))

# ### Question 1 - Feature Observation
# As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`. For each data point (neighborhood):
# - `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
# - `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
# - `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.
# 
# _Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`? Justify your answer for each._  
# **Hint:** Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?

# **Answer: **  Increasing 'RM' will increase the price of MEDV , as number of rooms increases the price of house and vice versa
# Higher 'LSTAT' means majority of the houses belong to lower class, means prices of houses are not high, easily affordable, so increasing LSTAT means that area is not occuied by rich people, so higher LSTAT means lower prices 
# Low PTRATIO means less teachers and large students, it implies that locality doesnt have good educational resources 
#

# 
# ## Developing a Model
# In this second section of the project, you will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in your predictions.

# ### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric
# It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at making predictions. 
# 
# The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._
# 
# For the `performance_metric` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Use `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to perform a performance calculation between `y_true` and `y_predict`.
# - Assign the performance score to the `score` variable.

# In[8]:

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

def performance_metric(y_true, y_predict):
    """ Calculates and returns the performance score between 
        true and predicted values based on the metric chosen. """
    
    # TODO: Calculate the performance score between 'y_true' and 'y_predict'
    score =r2_score(y_true,y_predict)
    
    # Return the score
    return score


# ### Question 2 - Goodness of Fit
# Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:
# 
# | True Value | Prediction |
# | :-------------: | :--------: |
# | 3.0 | 2.5 |
# | -0.5 | 0.0 |
# | 2.0 | 2.1 |
# | 7.0 | 7.8 |
# | 4.2 | 5.3 |
# *Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable? Why or why not?* 
# 
# Run the code cell below to use the `performance_metric` function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.

# In[ ]:

# Calculate the performance of this model
score = performance_metric([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2], [2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8, 5.3])
print "Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of {:.3f}.".format(score)


# **Answer:** 
#  R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.
#  R-squared = Explained variation / Total variation
#  R2 score of this model is 0.923 , which is very close to 1. Best possible R2 score is 1So this model has captured the variations of target variable

# ### Implementation: Shuffle and Split Data
# Your next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.
# 
# For the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.cross_validation` to shuffle and split the `features` and `prices` data into training and testing sets.
#   - Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
#   - Set the `random_state` for `train_test_split` to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.
# - Assign the train and testing splits to `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.

# In[19]:

# TODO: Import 'train_test_split'
from sklearn import cross_validation
# TODO: Shuffle and split the data into training and testing subsets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(features, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Success
print "Training and testing split was successful."


# ### Question 3 - Training and Testing
# *What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?*  
# **Hint:** What could go wrong with not having a way to test your model?

# **Answer: ** Machine learning is all about making a system able to take decisions on its own. This is achieved using training the system from some part of the dataset and by predicting on the remaining data. If all the data is used in training, there would be no way of testing the accuracy of the learning algorithm. It can lead to the problem of overfitting or underfitting. Algorithm becomes tailor made to the given dataset. 
# splitting into training and testing validates the algorithm and it performs better on the new unknown dataset

# ----
# 
# ## Analyzing Model Performance
# In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.

# ### Learning Curves
# The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of determination.  
# 
# Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following question.

# In[11]:

# Produce learning curves for varying training set sizes and maximum depths
vs.ModelLearning(features, prices)


# ### Question 4 - Learning the Data
# *Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model. What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve? Would having more training points benefit the model?*  
# **Hint:** Are the learning curves converging to particular scores?

# **Answer: ** Graph with max_depth =6 is most ideal graph. Initially testing score is low and training score is high. There is huge gap between trainingand testing scores. As more training points are added, testing scores increase gradually and there is not much difference between training and testing scores
# Graphs with depth 1 and 3 suffer from high bias. Intially testing score is very low, claerly this is a case of underfitting and high errors. As more data is added, both the scores converge to, so this implies the given model is not very adaptive to new datasets. Adding additional features is not going to help
# graph with max_depth 10 suffers from overfitting and high variance. Initially testing scores improved with addition of new training points. But around at 250 training points, the testing scores have reached the optimal scores, adding more training points is not going to help.

# ### Complexity Curves
# The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves â€” one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  
# 
# Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions.

# In[20]:

vs.ModelComplexity(X_train, y_train)


# ### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
# *When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?*  
# **Hint:** How do you know when a model is suffering from high bias or high variance?

# **Answer: **At max depth 1, it is underfitting the dataset , both training and test scores are low. Low scores imply high error on the training dataset This implies model already possesses answers it is supposed to predict. It suffers from high amount of bias. It pays litte attention to data oversimplified.
# At maximum depth 10, perfect score  can be seen, hence it suffers from high variance. Low test score and high training score indicate high variance. It indicates much higher error on validation set than training set. It starts to learn random noise and forgets to predict unseen data

# ### Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model
# *Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? What intuition lead you to this answer?*

# **Answer: ** I think maximum depth 5 generalises the databest. It neither overfits or suffers from high variance as in case of max depth =10 , nor underfits as in case of max depth=1 (high bias situation)

# -----
# 
# ## Evaluating Model Performance
# In this final section of the project, you will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`.

# ### Question 7 - Grid Search
# *What is the grid search technique and how it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?*

# **Answer: ** GridSearch is a way of systematically working through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it  determines which tune gives the best performance. It helps in selecting appropiate models based on the parameters we want to tune. It makes scorer function flexible.GridSearch trains and validates a model for every combination of hyperparameters available, but this is computationally intensive and can be unfeasible.GridSearch It is applied using GridSearchCV in sklearn.

# In[36]:


from sklearn import svm
X_train2, X_test2, y_train2, y_test2 = cross_validation.train_test_split(features, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1, probability=True).fit(X_train2, y_train2)
print clf.score(X_test2, y_test2)
scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(clf, features, prices, cv=5)
print (scores)
print scores.mean()


# ### Question 8 - Cross-Validation
# *What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?*  
# **Hint:** Much like the reasoning behind having a testing set, what could go wrong with using grid search without a cross-validated set?

# **Answer: ** The original dataset is partitioned into k subsets of equal sizes. One of these k subsets is taken as test set and remaining k-1 as training set.It requires k iterations hence, k times more computation time as compared to normal test train division but has higher accuracy. In each iteration, ith partition is taken is test and remaining k-1 as training sets.
# Cross validation is used to eliminate overfitting and make learning algorithm more accurate and generalised to independent datasets. Grid Search performs 3 fold cross validation, hence the model can be easily validated. Cross validatio ensures we have sufficiently good model.  Gridsearch provides parameter optimization and uses crosss validation to provide the optimal parameters

# ### Implementation: Fitting a Model
# Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.
# 
# In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_iter'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.
# 
# For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.
#   - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.
# - Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.
# - Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.
#   - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.
#   - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.
# - Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.
#   - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. 
#   - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable.

    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model
    grid = grid.fit(X, y)

    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data
    return grid.best_estimator_


# ### Making Predictions
# Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a *decision tree regressor*, the model has learned *what the best questions to ask about the input data are*, and can respond with a prediction for the **target variable**. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown â€” such as data the model was not trained on.

# ### Question 9 - Optimal Model
# _What maximum depth does the optimal model have? How does this result compare to your guess in **Question 6**?_  
# 
# Run the code block below to fit the decision tree regressor to the training data and produce an optimal model.

# In[40]:

# Fit the training data to the model using grid search
reg = fit_model(X_train, y_train)

# Produce the value for 'max_depth'
print "Parameter 'max_depth' is {} for the optimal model.".format(reg.get_params()['max_depth'])


# **Answer: ** Maximum depth is 4. I expected 5 . So my analysis is very close to the actual answer

# ### Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices
# Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your clients:
# 
# | Feature | Client 1 | Client 2 | Client 3 |
# | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
# | Total number of rooms in home | 5 rooms | 4 rooms | 8 rooms |
# | Neighborhood poverty level (as %) | 17% | 32% | 3% |
# | Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools | 15-to-1 | 22-to-1 | 12-to-1 |
# *What price would you recommend each client sell his/her home at? Do these prices seem reasonable given the values for the respective features?*  
# **Hint:** Use the statistics you calculated in the **Data Exploration** section to help justify your response.  
# 
# Run the code block below to have your optimized model make predictions for each client's home.

# In[41]:

# Produce a matrix for client data
client_data = [[5, 17, 15], # Client 1
               [4, 32, 22], # Client 2
               [8, 3, 12]]  # Client 3

# Show predictions
for i, price in enumerate(reg.predict(client_data)):
    print "Predicted selling price for Client {}'s home: ${:,.2f}".format(i+1, price)
    


# In[44]:

print features.describe()


# In[46]:

print prices.describe()


# **Answer: ** For client 1, RM=5, which is nearly equal to First Quartile value(Q1), LSTAT=17, which is nearly same as Q2(Second Quartile) and PTRATIO=15 lies between minimum value and Q1, so the actual price of the house should be around $350,700.05 and the predicted price comes out to $391,183.23 . So they are getting a very good price, they can sell their homes at the predicted price.
# For client 2, RM=4, which lies near the minimum of RM statistics LSTAT=37, which is maximum poverty ratio, PTRATIO=22 which is also maximum, so the actual price of the house should be somewhat more than the minimum of statistical data, i.e around $150,000.05 . The predicted price comes to me $189,123.53, The client can sell their house as the predicted price is in accordance with the data.
# For client 3, RM=8, which lies near the the maximum value; LSTAT=3, which lies between minimum and Q1, PTRATIO=12, this shows students to teacher ratio is very less, more teachers per students, The actual price of the house must be a bit less than the maximum of the data, that is nearly $1,000,900.06. The predicted price is also in accordance with the statistical price.

# ### Sensitivity
# An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable â€” i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on.

# ### Question 11 - Applicability
# *In a few sentences, discuss whether the constructed model should or should not be used in a real-world setting.*  
# **Hint:** Some questions to answering:
# - *How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978?*
# - *Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home?*
# - *Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?*
# - *Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?*

# **Answer: ** 
# 
# I would not use this model to prodict the selling price Boston houses for the clients. I think not all the model features are relevant. Also the error is greater than 15% which an experience realator can predict with same error. In addition to all mentioned data set has small number of instances comparing to its feature set which plays an important role into model acuuracy
